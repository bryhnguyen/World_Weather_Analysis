# World_Weather_Analysis

## Description

  This project objectively served to demonstrate proficiency of making API Calls from the Weather API from OpenWeatherMap.org and the Directions API from the Google Maps API Platform to create an application for users to plan vacations. The application uses the Google Maps API to create a map that displays markers for cities in countries with hotels and weather descriptors. Through this app, users can:
* Input desired minimum and maximum temperatures
* Find Cities that fit the temparature parameters
* Find nearby hotels within a 5000 meter radius of the cities
* Plan stops to nearby cities 
* Receive Walking, Bicycling, or Driving directions between the destinations
